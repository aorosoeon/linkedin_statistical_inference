for selenium to work in this setup you need to download chromedriver (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
you can store it either in the folder or somewhere in your system, in my case, it's stored in "/usr/bin/chromedriver" on raspberry pi. the later option is recommended.
potentially, your current version might be outdated someday and this can cause some problems.
there some implementations on the internet of automatic updater of chromedriver, but for the sake of simplicity i don't use them here.
